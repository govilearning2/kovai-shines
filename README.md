# Traffic Prediction API

Smart traffic optimization service for EaseMyTrip Gen AI Hackathon - Intelligent travel time predictions using real-time GPS and itinerary data.

## 🎯 Overview

This AI-powered service automatically optimizes travel times by analyzing traffic patterns when users reach each location in their itinerary. It intelligently uses GPS coordinates and destination data to provide the best departure times.

## 🚀 Smart Features

### 🕒 Optimal Timing Intelligence
- **Best Departure Time**: AI predicts the optimal time to leave current location
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Uses BigQuery ML to analyze historical traffic data
- **Time Savings**: Shows how much time you can save by traveling at optimal times

### 📱 GPS-Driven Automation
- **Location-Aware**: Automatically triggers when user reaches itinerary locations
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Uses current GPS position as source coordinates
- **Next Destination Ready**: Seamlessly plans route to next itinerary stop

### 🧠 Intelligent Predictions
- **Historical Data**: Leverages comprehensive traffic pattern database
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Analyzes 20+ different departure time options
- **Best vs Worst**: Compares optimal timing against peak traffic periods

## 🏆 Hackathon Innovation

**Problem Solved**: Travelers waste time in traffic due to poor departure timing

**AI Solution**: 
- Automatically detects when user arrives at itinerary locations
- Analyzes traffic patterns for next destination
- Recommends optimal departure time to minimize travel duration
- Saves travelers significant time through intelligent timing

## 🛠️ Core Functionality

### `/predict-traffic`
**When it works**: User reaches a location in their itinerary
**What it does**: 
- Takes current GPS coordinates (source)
- Uses next itinerary destination (destination)  
- Predicts best departure time
- Shows potential time savings

**Smart Response**:
- **Best departure time** with exact duration
- **Time saved** compared to worst traffic periods
- **Total analysis** of traffic scenarios considered

## 💡 Real-World Usage

### Travel Itinerary Flow
1. **User arrives** at Hotel/Location A (GPS detected)
2. **API automatically triggered** with current position + next destination
3. **AI recommends**: "Leave in 2 hours to save 15 minutes travel time"
4. **Smart scheduling**: User gets optimal departure notification

### Business Value
- **Reduces travel stress** through proactive planning
- **Saves actual time** by avoiding peak traffic
- **Improves trip experience** with intelligent automation
- **Increases user satisfaction** with predictive travel insights

## 📊 Example Scenario

**User Journey**: Hotel in Coimbatore → Ooty Hill Station
- **Current GPS**: Hotel location (auto-detected)
- **Next Destination**: From user's itinerary
- **AI Prediction**: Leave at 6:00 AM to save 18 minutes vs 9:00 AM departure
- **Result**: Smoother journey, less traffic stress

## 🎯 Hackathon Impact

- **Proactive Travel Planning**: No more guessing optimal departure times
- **GPS Intelligence**: Seamless location-aware recommendations  
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Traffic predictions based on real historical patterns
- **User Experience**: Automated optimization without manual input
